:fire: A blazing-fast static site generator that uses Laravel's Blade templating engine and leverages JSON or Markdown files for super-extensible content.

```bash
composer create-project aschmelyun/cleaver your-site-name
```

## Requirements
- PHP 7.1 or higher
- Fairly recent version of node + npm 

## Installation

After creating your project with Composer, cd inside your project's root directory and install node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

From there you can build the site using the included demo content, which outputs to a `dist/` folder in your project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Modifying your assets

Cleaver uses SCSS for styling, and there's a basic skeleton structure set up in the `resources/assets/sass` directory. Tailwind is imported by default so you can jump right in to rapid development and prototyping.

There's a bootstrapped JavaScript file that imports lodash, jQuery, and Vue dependencies through npm to use with your project. That can be modified by editing the `resources/assets/js/app.js` file.

## Building the site

To compile the SCSS/JS assets and build the static site files, you can run `npm run dev` from the root. Additionally, using `npm run watch` starts up a local node server that you can use to view your compiled project, and will watch the entire `resources/` directory for changes to any assets, views, or content files.

If you would like to build your site without compiling the assets, run the `php cleaver` command from the project root.

## Publishing your site

Once you're ready to publish your site, simply run the command:

```bash
npm run production
```

Which will minify your assets and build the site again with the new versioned files.

You can then publish your entire project to a host of your choice as long as the web root is pointed to the `/dist` folder. Additionally, you're free to just publish the built files in the dist folder by themselves.

## Roadmap
Cleaver is still very much in development, and while it's designed to remain as simple as possible there's a few features that could make for a better overall experience. Here's what's on the path ahead:

- [x] Ability to use folders in content directory
- [x] Add collection containing all content into each view
- [ ] Ability to add in and use HTML in JSON content files
- [ ] More detailed build errors if something goes wrong
- [ ] A better cli interface and style during site builds
